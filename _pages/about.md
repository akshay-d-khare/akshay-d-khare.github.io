I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Maverick Quantum (mavQ)](https://mavq.com/home), working on interesting problems in the domain of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Presently, I am building a Document AI system for information extraction from documents.

Prior to this, I graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in July 2020 with a dual degree (Bachelors and Masters), where I graduated as a silver medalist, ranked first among my undergraduate department cohort. I was supervised by [Prof. Harish Guruprasad](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/) from the Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras for my masters thesis on developing novel approaches for domain adaptation, particularly for machine learning problems involving label-dependent distribution shift. I was also fortunate to work as a research intern with [Prof. Philip Scarf](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/2480178-scarf-philip) on statistical modelling in sports in the summer of 2019 at University of Salford, UK.

If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to send me an email!
