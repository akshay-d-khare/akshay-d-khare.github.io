I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Maverick Quantum (mavQ)](https://mavq.com/home), working on interesting problems in the domain of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Presently, I am building a Document AI system for information extraction from documents.

Previously, I graduated from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in July 2020 with a dual degree (Bachelors and Masters) where I was ranked first among my undergraduate cohort. My masters thesis was on learning multiple diverse classifiers to adapt to label-dependent distribution shift and was guided by [Dr. Harish Guruprasad](https://sites.google.com/site/harishguruprasad/) from the Department of Computer Science, IIT Madras. I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Philip Scarf](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/2480178-scarf-philip) in the summer of 2019 on statistical modelling in sports at University of Salford, UK.

If you have any questions or opportunities for collabotation, please feel free to send me an email!
